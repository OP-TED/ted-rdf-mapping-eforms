== Toolchain

=== No custom tooling

While there is a comprehensive set of https://docs.ted.europa.eu/SWS/mapping_suite/toolchain.html[command-line software tools for the SF mapping project], there is no such tooling provided for the eForms mapping project. The complete transformation cycle is supported in and carried out already by the https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline[pipeline].

=== RMLMapper for development

For development, simple https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java[RMLMapper] commands (which the SF tools use) can be employed directly, for example:

```
rmlmapper -m $MAPPINGS_FOLDER/* -s turtle > $OUTPUT_FILE
```

where the `$MAPPING_FOLDER` is a folder with the right package structure, and
`$OUTPUT_FILE` is the desired RDF output file, usually suffixed with the `.ttl`
extension (for the Turtle serialization as provided with the `-s` argument).
